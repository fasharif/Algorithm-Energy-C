🧮 # Algorithm-Energy-C

Compare how different algorithms perform, showing the “energy” cost of computation⚡🪫

Goal: Compare how different algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort) perform in time and number of operations, showing the “energy” cost of computation.

📊 Plus Python script visualizes results.

✅ Run everything:

make
./energy_explorer
python3 visualize.py

You’ll see runtime and operations for each algorithm and graphs showing which is more efficient (the “energy-friendly” one).
